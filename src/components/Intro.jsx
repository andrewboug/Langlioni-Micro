          The Langlioni Micro is an open face oven with an oven floor that
          rotates the pizza concentrically for easy attendance, and time
          averaging of pizza exposure to local thermal variations in the baking
          chamber, to produce even baking in a thermal environment that is not
          uniform.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          A forced air natural gas burner heats the baking chamber and is
          controlled electronically to target temperatures sensing temperature
          at the top of the baking chamber using a thermocouple.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This independent thermal system bakes the top of the pizza in hot air.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          A separate forced air natural gas burner is positioned under the oven
          floor and is controlled electronically using signals from sensors that
          measure infrared light emissions from both the top and bottom surfaces
          of the oven floor, such that target temperatures can be set on the top
          and bottom surfaces of the floor, as the pizza bakes by contact heat
          conduction from the mass of the oven floor.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>This independent thermal system bakes the bottom of the pizza. </p>
        <p>
          Now, for the first time in history, temperature conditions for the top
          and bottom of the pizza can be set and controlled independently, so
          that the top and bottom of the pizza can bake to desired
          specifications in the same baking cycle.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If the top or bottom of the pizza is overdone, the chamber or floor
          can be set to a cooler temperature. Underdone? The chamber or floor
          can be set to higher temperature settings, as needed.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          When a pizza is removed from the oven, the floor will be cooled
          because of heat loss from the hot floor to the cold pizza dough by
          thermal conduction. When the pizza is removed from the oven floor, the
          oven floor will refresh to target conditions, unattended, and display
          top and bottom surface temperatures visibly on the oven to signal
          readiness for another baking cycle.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If long baking cycles are desired, IR light from the bottom of the
          oven floor can be monitored to control the temperature of the floor,
          while the top of the floor is unavailable for monitoring because it is
          covered by the pizza.{" "}

          This 900-degree flatbread oven fits in a 30”x 26”x 42” space, weighs
          about 60 pounds, installs nicely in a residential kitchen, in a
          conventional oven cabinet. It only requires a conventional 5-inch
          furnace vent, a 120 VAC supply, and a 5/8” gas supply line.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the only oven to offer these features and this capability.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This oven performs like a 6,000-pound refractory monster of ancient
          oven technology, but fires in 35 minutes. It uses less fuel, does not
          require pizza rotation by hand, occupies less space, and operates with
          advanced electronic temperature controls. It comes in a box and can be
          installed in an hour or two.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>Finally, an oven you can turn your back on!</p>
        <p>
          The sacred ubiquitous handheld IR thermometer gun is suddenly
          obsolete.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives the pizzaiolio unprecedented control of the oven for
          reliable reproducible baking conditions.{" "}
